Edge Cases & How We Handled Them

1. **Header Metadata**
   - **Issue**: The text file includes a lot of header/license info before the actual verses.
   - **Solution**: We skip all content before the "aṣṭāvakragītā" marker to begin cleanly from the actual verses.

2. **Multiline Verses**
   - **Issue**: Some verses are written in two lines but extracted as a single block.
   - **Solution**: We use regex with `re.DOTALL` so it captures multiline blocks correctly.

3. **Non-standard formatting**
   - **Issue**: The verse and index are joined with "// Avg_x.x", which isn’t a standard delimiter.
   - **Solution**: Regex pattern `r"(.*?)//\s*Avg_(\d+\.\d+)"` captures everything before `//` and extracts the index correctly.

4. **Unicode Sanskrit characters**
   - **Issue**: Some tools might break with Unicode handling.
   - **Solution**: Used `ensure_ascii=False` in `json.dump()` to keep the original Devanagari script intact.

5. **Clean file output**
   - **Issue**: Output could have weird line breaks or extra whitespace.
   - **Solution**: `.strip().replace("", "")` is applied to clean each verse.
